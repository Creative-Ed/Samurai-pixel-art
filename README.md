# Samurai-pixel-art
picturing a Samurai in different body types and creating pixel based versions of them... for the fun of it

My inspiration for this work is purely fun and imaginative, and I'm happy with the outcome of my imagination of what a Samurai,
a fat Samurai and a Dwarf Samurai would look like.

They are far from perfect, but they are expressed with clarity and sends the message across.
